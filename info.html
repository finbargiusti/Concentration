                <p>Concentration is a system for students and the self-employed to concentrate by blocking the sites they usually get distracted until they have finished by tasks. It was made by <a href="http://facebook.com/finbargiusti">Finbar Giusti</a> with the intention of entering it into the BT Young Scientist And Technology Exibition.</p>
                <h2>How was it built?</h2>
                <p>It is written in C++ with Qt libraries for graphics.</p>

                <p>Finbar wrote the system on his <a href="http://linux.org">Linux</a> laptop in 2017. Generally during the summer. He wrote the code , commited and pushed it to Github as often as he could.</p>
